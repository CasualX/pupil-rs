Arithmetic expression evaluator written in Rust.

It implements a butchered [Shunting-yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm).

Pupil
-----

To build the pupil executable, run `cargo build`. Append the `--release` switch as needed for optimized builds.

It has three different use cases:

* Interactive mode.

  Enter expressions and press enter to evaluate them.

  ```text
  PATH/TO/CRATE/ROOT> cargo run
  Welcome to pupil, the arithmetic expression evaluator.

  Enter an expression, eg. 2 + 3, and press enter.
  Press ctrl-C to exit.

  >>> 2 + 3
  5
  >>> ^C
  ```

* Provide the expression to evaluate as command line arguments.

  This allows to evaluate a single expression and then exit.

  ```text
  PATH/TO/CRATE/ROOT> cargo run -- 2 + 3
  Welcome to pupil, the arithmetic expression evaluator.
  Ok: 5
  ```

* Pipe input.

  Evaluates every line as separate expressions and prints the result line by line.

  ```text
  PATH/TO/CRATE/ROOT> echo 2 + 3 | cargo run
  5
  ```

Library
-------

This library can be found on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/pupil).

In your `Cargo.toml` put:

```text
[dependencies]
pupil = "0.2"
```

A practical example can be found in `src/bin/pupil.rs`.

Documentation can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/pupil).

Usage
-----

Simple usage:

```rust
// Create a basic environment with the default builtins
let mut env = pupil::BasicEnv::default();

// Evaluate expressions in this environment
let result = pupil::eval(&env, "2 + 3");
assert_eq!(result, Ok(5.0));
```
